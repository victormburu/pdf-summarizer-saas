## ‚úÖ Summary: What You've Learned About `Matplotlib`

### üß† 1. **What is Matplotlib?**

Matplotlib is a powerful **data visualization library** in Python. It allows you to create a wide range of static, animated, and interactive plots.

* Core module used: `matplotlib.pyplot` (imported as `plt`)
* Often used with `NumPy` or `Pandas` for visualizing numerical data.

### üìä 2. **Types of Plots You've Used and Learned**

| Plot Type          | Use Case                                                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Line Plot**      | Show trends or change over time or ordered values        |
| **Bar Chart**      | Compare quantities across categories                     |
| **Pie Chart**      | Show part-to-whole relationship                          |
| **Histogram**      | Show distribution/frequency of data                      |
| **Box Plot**       | Visualize spread, median, and outliers in data           |
| **Scatter Plot**   | Identify correlations and patterns between two variables |
| **Stacked Bar**    | Show breakdown of each category across parts             |
| **Horizontal Bar** | Better for long labels or horizontal comparisons         |

### ‚öôÔ∏è 3. **Key Plot Customization Skills**

You've practiced how to:

* Set **titles** (`plt.title("Title")`)
* Label **axes** (`plt.xlabel()` / `plt.ylabel()`)
* Change **colors**, **sizes**, **markers**
* Rotate **x-axis labels** (for readability)
* Use **legends** for multi-series plots (`plt.legend()`)
* Control **figure size** (`plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))`)
* Add **grid lines** (`plt.grid(True)`)

---

### üìê 4. **Axes & Data Relationships**

You now understand how:

* X-axis = independent variable
* Y-axis = dependent variable
* The type of plot you choose **depends on the story you want to tell.**

---

### üìå 5. **Best Practices You‚Äôve Practiced**

* Always **sort** data before line plots (to avoid zig-zags)
* Use **scatter plots** for continuous-variable relationships
* Use **bar and pie charts** only for **categorical data**
* Avoid clutter and overlapping with label rotation and spacing

---

### üîÆ 6. **Bonus Features You've Touched**

* `alpha` for transparency
* `color maps` for scatter plot enhancement
* Using **markers**, **line styles**, and **legends**
* Basic use of **plot interactivity** (zoom, save, etc.)
